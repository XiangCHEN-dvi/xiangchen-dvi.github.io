I am a researcher at Beijing Zhongguancun Academy. I received both my B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University.

Prior to my current position, I worked at Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab, where my research mainly focuses on utilizing AI and optimization algorithms for data-driven modeling, simulation, optimization, and control. The research objects can be categorized into two types:
- simple physical systems (surrogate simulation and inverse design for electromagnetics, mechanics, material, etc.)
- complex industrial systems (deep learning based sensing, modeling, parameter optimization, and optimal control for cellular networks, data center networks, optical networks, household appliances, power grids, computing clusters, etc.).
The research outcomes have been widely deployed across Huawei business units, including ICT, CBG, HiSilicon, Computing, Car, etc.

My current research interests include:
- Data-driven and physics-driven hybrid modeling, and its application in general scenarios as well as specific domains such as medical, mechanics, materials, etc.
- 3D representations and its applications in 2B (CAD/CAE) and 2C (world models) by constructing surrogate simulators, generative models, and inverse design (PDE-constrained optimization, 3D reconstruction).
- Scientific foundation models, multi-modal models for STEM.
